# PyMerger

PyMerger is a Python tool for detecting binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the Einstein
Telescope (ET), based on a Deep Residual Neural Network model (ResNet).

## Overview

PyMerger is a Python tool that a Deep Residual Neural Network model to identify BBH mergers without the need for data whitening or band-passing. The model is trained on three sub-detector combined data of ET..
