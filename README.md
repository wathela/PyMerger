# PyMerger

PyMerger is a Python tool for detecting binary black hole mergers from the Einstein
Telescope, based on a Deep Residual Neural Network model.

## Overview

PyMerger is a Python tool that uses a Deep Residual Neural Network model to identify BBH mergers without the need for data whitening or band-passing. The model is trained on three sub-detectors combined data of ET.

## Installation
