# PyMerger

PyMerger is a Python tool for detecting binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the Einstein
Telescope (ET), based on a Deep Residual Neural Network model (ResNet).

## Overview

This project trains and uses neural network models to identify BBH mergers without the need for data whitening or band-passing. The models are trained on both single detector and three detector combined data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PyMerger.git
   cd PyMerger

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
  ```sh
  python pymerger.py --input-file-dir path/to/your/data --output-dir path/to/save/results
